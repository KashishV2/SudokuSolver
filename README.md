# Sudoku Solver

INTRODUCTION-

The Sudoku Solver Project is designed to develop a program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. Sudoku is a popular puzzle game where players fill a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, following specific rules.

    



## LOGIC OF THE PROBLEM

Step 1: Understand the Problem

- Sudoku is a 9x9 grid divided into 9 3x3 sub-grids (regions)
- Each region, row, and column must contain numbers 1-9 without repetition
- The program should take an incomplete Sudoku grid as input and fill it correctly

Step 2: Represent the Grid

- Use a 2D array (9x9) to represent the Sudoku grid
- Initialize the grid with given values (0 for empty cells)
Step 3: Solve the Sudoku

- Find Empty Cells: Iterate through the grid to find empty cells (0)
- Check Valid Numbers: For each empty cell, check which numbers (1-9) are valid
 Check row, column, and region constraints

- Recursion: If a valid number is found, recursively call the solve function
   Backtracking: If no valid number is found, backtrack to previous cell

 Step 4:Implement the Algorithm
 -Create a function solveSudoku(grid) to solve the Sudoku 
 -Use recursion and backtracking to fill the grid 
 -Implement row, column, and region checks
